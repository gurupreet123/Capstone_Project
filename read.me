🔌 IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter with Theft Detection & Remote Monitoring
This project is a smart energy meter system developed using IoT technologies such as ESP32, GSM modules, current/voltage sensors, and a mobile app interface (Blynk). It provides real-time energy consumption monitoring, remote load control, billing automation, and theft detection capabilities.

📌 Features
📲 Real-time Monitoring of voltage, current, and power using ESP32

🧾 Automated Billing system based on live data

🔐 Theft Detection logic to monitor tampering or unauthorized usage

☁️ Cloud Storage of readings for historical analysis (via Firebase/Thingspeak)

🔌 Remote Load Control through mobile app

📉 Energy Usage Graphs and trend visualization

📱 Blynk Integration for user-friendly mobile interface

⚙️ Technologies Used
Component	Description
ESP32	Microcontroller for processing and communication
ZMPT101B	Voltage sensor
SCT-013	Current sensor
Blynk App	Mobile app interface
Firebase / Thingspeak	Cloud storage and data visualization
GSM Module (SIM800L)	SMS alerts and communication (optional)
Relay Module	For remote load switching
🛠️ How It Works
Sensors measure real-time voltage and current.

ESP32 calculates power usage and pushes data to Firebase/Thingspeak.

The Blynk app displays readings and allows control over connected appliances.

Theft detection logic identifies anomalies and alerts the user.

Monthly bills are generated automatically using consumption data.
